/*
the gun is a real object (but without collisions probably)
connected to the player with a joint maybe
aiming is done by applying forces and damping to it, just like player stanging
that way the movement of the gun is realistic and player has to wait before it stabilizes
-> no instant aiming, much harder aimbots
-> player cant turn around/move and aim precisely immediately
